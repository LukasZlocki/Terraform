Terraform
Place for my terraform projects & learnings.

Description:
Infrastructure as code (IaC) is natural next steps in my learings. 
I am working on my backend and frontend projects and its high time to move on to have fun with some infrastructure 
to show the projects out there. But dealing with my phisical equipment take lots of affords and take lots of time.
But what if I can build infrastructure right away just from source code ... no cables, no errors, fast building, fast destroying 
... the answer is terraform.   

Technologies expected in projects: 
Terraform
docker
docker-compose
C#
.Net
ms sql 
azure
